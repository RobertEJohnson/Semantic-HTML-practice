# Main Flow Content

There should only ever be one ```<main>``` tag and it should have  the main content for the page.

It's good practice to have the ```<h1>``` tag to be a first thing within the main.

A ```<section>``` tag is a great way to section of content of all the same accord within a ```<main>``` tag. If all of the information pertains to one topic it can be wrapped in ```<section>```.
