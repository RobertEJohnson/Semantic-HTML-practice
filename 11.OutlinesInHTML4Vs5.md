# Comparing Outlines in HTML4 vs. HTML5

The way outlines are created for assistive technologies varies between HTML4 and HTML5. It's good to hit targets in both camps.

## HTML4 Outlines

Outlines are created from **implicit Sections**, this meanings headings and their nested structure.

```<h1> - <h6>```

```<h1>```Internet Cats
    ```<h2>```YouTube Videos
        ```<h3>```Cats in boxes
        ```<h3>```Cats jumping
    ```<h2>```Famous Cats
        ```<h3>```Lil Bub
        ```<h3>```Maru
        ```<h3>```Colonel Meow
        ```<h3>```Grumpy Cat
    ```<h2>```Cat Memes


## HTML5 Outlines

Outlines are created from **sectioning elements** explicitly.

The four elements used to make outlines in HTML5 are,
```<aside>```, ```<article>```, ```<section>```, and ```<nav>``` tags.

```<article>```Internet Cats
    ```<section><h2>```YouTube Videos
            Cats in boxes
            Cats jumping
    ```<section><h2>```Famous Cats
            Lil Bub
            Maru
            Colonel Meow
            Grumpy Cat
    ```<section><h2>```Cat Memes
