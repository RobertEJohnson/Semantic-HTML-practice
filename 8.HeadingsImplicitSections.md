# Headings / Implicit Sections

## Implicit Sections
HTML 4 way of outlining sections.

Same level heading closes the previous level and starts a new section at the same level!

A higher level closes that level and starts a new implicit one at a higher level.

- h1 Internet Cats
    - h2 YouTube Videos
      - h3 Cats in boxes
      - h3 Cats Jumping (Closes previous section)
    - h2 Famous Cats (closes the previous section, and goes up one level)
      - h3 Lil Bub
      - h3 Maru (closes)
      - h3 Colonel Meow (closes)
      - h3 Grumpy Cat (closes)
  - h2 Cat Memes (closes the lower level and starts a new implicit one at the higher level)
  

> "<h1>-<h6> elements should NOT be used to markup subheadings, subtitles, alternative titles and taglines.

>Unless intended to be the heading for a new section or subsection." - The W3C

The reason we aren't allowed to use heading elements to markup subheadings or subtitles etc is because of how important they are to making the HTML Outline for assistive technologies.

If a subheading is just supporting the heading information and NOT creating a new section it should not be a heading tag. It should be a ```<p>``` tag.
