## Sectioning and Grouping Elements

    Elements whose intended use in to divide content into logical sections

   1. Headers
   2. Main Content
   3. Footer

    - div
      - **A div is a semantically meaningless element.** It is used to group elements together for styling purposes.
      - Prior to HTML5 the div was the only way to group things together, with HTML5 there are new elements that are more semantic/descriptive of their content.

Here are some elements added for HTML5
    - aside
      - Information that is related to but separate from other content on a a page
    - article
      - A standalone piece of content that is publishable on its own. For example, a blog article.
    - section
      - A section of related content that can logically be grouped together. Used for outline purposes and not styling purposes.
    - figure
      - Groups together content related to, but separate from main content flow. Could be charts, images, illustrations etc.
    - address
      - Contact information for the closest article or body ancestor
    - nav
      - Groups together navigation elements. Could be main navigation links, or other groups of internal links.
    - main
      - Groups together content in the main flow.
    - header
      - A group of content with introductory content such as heading elements, navigation, or a logo.
    - footer
      - A footer for the nearest content section or section element. Contains content like author and copyright information, or links to other related content.


### Notes

Headers! I haven't been using these and I should. All introduction information can go here, like navigation, logo, and heading elements.

It might seem odd at first to include a logo with in a nav container but if you think about it, if you can click on the logo and navigate to the home page, its a nav-link.

Divs are still okay! Not all divs are bad, they are meant for usage when they are only grouping things together for stylistic purposes.
