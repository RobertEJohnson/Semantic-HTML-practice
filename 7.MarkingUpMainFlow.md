# Marking up the Main Flow

Be careful marking up ```<main>```'s.

We should not be putting asides within the main flow of the content. ```<aside>```'s should always be separate. A good tes of whether something is an ```<aside>``` or not is if it can be taken out of the page without really affecting the content. Its just extra. It's helpful, but doesn't really fit in a ```<main>```.

```<article>``` are always covering content that are fully capable of being standalone articles. Much to the effect of newspaper articles being able to stand on their own from the newspaper. Or news articles being able to be their own stories.

## A Good Semantic Test

- If I move this piece how does it affect the flow?

If I move this, does the content flow get affected? Can I put it at the top or bottom? Does that change things? You can determine how things might be labeled with test involving moving it around.

```<figure> and <figcaption>``` are great ones for this test since they are: Content that is related to the main content, but is positioned independently of the main flow. Like a chart, diagram, illustration, or image; it usually has a caption.
