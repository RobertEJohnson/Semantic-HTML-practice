Semantic HTML is markup that conveys meaning about its content

------- First problem ---------
<p>555 Candycane Lane</p>
<p>Penquintown, Antartica 73105-203</p>
<p>All content on this site &copy; Candytown Corporations</p>

-------- First new iteration ---------
- Add an address tag to wrap address
- Add a small tag to wrap traditionally small text
  
<address>
    <p>555 Candycane Lane</p>
    <p>Penquintown, Antartica 73105-203</p>
    <p>All content on this site &copy; Candytown Corporations</p>
</address>

<p>
    <small>
        All content on this site &copy; Candytown Corporations
    </small>
</p>

------- Second iteration ------------
-Wrap all of footer content in a footer tag

*Now semantically we know there is a footer which contains an address, and also some small text that contains a &copy symbol.

-> Before we just had two paragraph tags

<footer>
    <address>
        <p>555 Candycane Lane</p>
        <p>Penquintown, Antartica 73105-203</p>
        <p>All content on this site &copy; Candytown Corporations</p>
    </address>

    <p>
        <small>
            All content on this site &copy; Candytown Corporations
        </small>
    </p>
</footer>
