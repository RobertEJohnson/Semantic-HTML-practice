# Creating out Outline with Headings

---
## Heading Question

Is it starting a new section?

**IF YES**: Use the appropriate Heading level tag.
**IF NO**: Use a ```<p>``` tag.

## Fixing Bee-keeping HTML

Remove presentational headings. Avoid using them that way.

h1-h6 but never skip a heading category.

## Heading Tip

Go into Microsoft Word or Google docs etc, and create an outline. This will be especially helpful for just starting out and can really clear the air for whether you should be starting another section or creating a subheading with a ```<p>``` tag.
