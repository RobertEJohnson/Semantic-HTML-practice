# Finishing up our Outline

Touching up the beekeeping HTML file, we can use the header tag to group up our heading and subtitle paragraph.

From:
```
    <h2>One for the Honey: A Beginner's Guide to Bees and Beekeeping</h2>
    <p>Request a free copy</p>
```

To:
```
    <header>
        <h2>One for the Honey: A Beginner's Guide to Bees and Beekeeping</h2>
        <p>Request a free copy</p>
    </header>
```

Even though a heading tag can be used at the top of the page, it should not be discouraged from being used to group other things that would fit within its semantic meaning elsewhere.

Its meaning:
><header>

>A group of content with introductory content such as heading elements, navigation, or a logo.

So this clearly fits here for the heading and subtitle content even though its further down on the page.

## Two Things to Remember

1. Use Sectioning Elements to create logical headings (HTML5)
2. Use Headings to create implicit sections (until HTML5 way is used, which it might be now as this course is 2016)
