# HTML Outlines

It is possible to hide content visually with a class if you want to create a heading for accessability but don't want it to appear visually. This way screen-readers, etc still have access to it? I'm pretty sure I understood that right. If you're struggling figuring out sectioning of articles with headings etc, sometimes it can be helpful to group them all within a new heading something like 'All Articles'.
