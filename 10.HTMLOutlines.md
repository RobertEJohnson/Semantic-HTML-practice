# HTML Outlines

It is possible to hide content visually with a class if you want to create a heading for accessability but don't want it to appear visually. This way screen-readers, etc still have access to it? I'm pretty sure I understood that right. If you're struggling figuring out sectioning of articles with headings etc, sometimes it can be helpful to group them all within a new heading something like 'All Articles'.

## 'Hiding' Classes

Say we have an aside, 'Recent Articles'. Visually we can see there are links to other articles beneath this heading. However, without visuals this would be more clear as 'Links to Recent Articles'. It is possible to have the best semantic/viewing experience by some clever hide classes and a span

### The Hide Class CSS

```
.hidden{
    /*Hide content visually, but not from screen readers*/
    position: absolute;
    left:-10000px;
    top:auto;
    width:1px;
    height:1px;
    overflow:hidden;
}
```

### Application of Hiding Classes

By applying the ```hidden``` class, we can use a semantically meaningless container like a ```<span>``` tag and remove the content from the flow of the page for visual readers yet technically not be removing the content for screen-readers etc.

Here's how it would work with changing 'Recent Articles' to 'Links to Recent Articles' for assistive technologies.

```
<h2>
    <span class="hidden">Links to</span>
    Recent Articles
</h2>
```
