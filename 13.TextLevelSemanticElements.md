# Text Level Semantic Elements

>Text-Level Semantics

>Elements that are descriptive of inline-level, or intra-paragraph, content.

So, **inline-level** and **intra-paragraph** content semantics.

These things include these tags:
- <a>
- <em>
- <strong>
- <small>
- <cite>
- <dfn>
- <abbr>
- <time>
- <span>
- <b>
- <i>
- and many more, though used less often.

Screen Readers can *read out content differently* with the use of text level semantics so something misused can confuse assistive technology users as it will have a different meaning.

## The <em> Tag

Is used to place stress emphasis on words.
This tag is typically misused to add italics.

If trying to add italics to a book etc we should be using the cite tag.

## The <cite> Tag

Represents the tile of a work, name of an author or reference.

This not used just to add italics.

## The <small> Tag

Is used on side comments like disclaimers, caveats, legal restrictions, copyrights, or attribution. Intended for short runs of text.

These are typically displayed in smaller text, but that is not a requirement for this tag of course, just the above definition.

## The <abbr> Tag

Represents an abbreviation or acronym.

This should be accompanied by a title attribute with the full unabbreviated text as the value.

Example usage,
From:
```
5 USD
```

To:
```
5 <abbr title="United States Dollar">USD</abbr>
```

By using an ```<abbr>``` tag screen readers will read the full unabbreviated version helping with accessability, also visual users can hover over the word and get a tooltip that will display the unabbreviated version. 

NOTE:
<abbr> is used for BOTH abbreviations and acronyms.

## The <time> Tag

Represents a time or a precise date.
