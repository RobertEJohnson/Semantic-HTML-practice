# Semantics Screen Readers

I downloaded ChromeVox, it looks a little dated but seems to work just fine. Comparing the older beekeping-guide.html file with ChromeVox to the newer file is pretty neat.

The older file without the semantic HTML *does NOT tell* a screenreader user that the navigation bar is exactly that. 

A screenreader user would be left basically assuming the words are just text unless they could guess that they are links from how they are named. They have no given indication however, which is super cruddy.
