# Auditing a Site for Semantic Issues

## Things to Look Out For
- Generic Elements
- Inconsistent Structure
- Presentational markup

## Semantic Checklist
- Is the HTML descriptive of the content.
- How is the content structured?
- Are any elements used presentationally?

### Is the HTML descriptive of its content?

- What is the element's intended purpose?
- What are we describing? Does this match its intended purpose?
- Is there a more descriptive element we could use?
  - Often there are multiple elements that could describe an element but some will be more descriptive than others.

### How is our Content Structured in our Document?

- Our HTML is building an outline used by search engines and assistive technologies.
    - builds a physical outline
    - can skip around to different headings

### Are there any elements that are used purely presentationally?

- Be careful using semantic HTML.
  - Strong tags should NOT be used to create bold text.
  - Strong tags are used to represent text that has strong importance.
